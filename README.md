# AI-Licensing
A place to discuss the potential of new licenses tailored to the use of AI architectures, their data, and the resulting models.

## AI Generated Example Licenses
After a brief collaboration with GPT-4, we generated the following 3 licenses:
1. [AI Model Training and Non-Commercial Use License (AMTN)](licenses/AMTN.md)
2. [Creative Use and AI Training Restriction License (CUATR)](licenses/CUATR.md)
3. [AI Model Training and Commercial Use License (AMTC)](licenses/AMTC.md)

## External, Novel Licenses
* The bleeding edge, image generator DeepFloyd IF ([GitHub](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF)/[HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DeepFloyd/IF)) has created [two licenses for different use cases](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF#license): 
  1. [DeepFloyd IF (Model) License](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF/blob/develop/LICENSE-MODEL) required to use the model through HuggingFace.
  2. [DeepFloyd IF (Open Source) License](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF/blob/develop/LICENSE) for use of the codebase.
