# AI-Licensing
A place to discuss the potential of new licenses tailored to the use of AI architectures, their data, and the resulting models.

## AI Generated Example Licenses
After a brief collaboration with GPT-4, we generated the following 3 licenses:
1. [AI Model Training and Non-Commercial Use License (AMTN)](licenses/AMTN.md)
2. [Creative Use and AI Training Restriction License (CUATR)](licenses/CUATR.md)
3. [AI Model Training and Commercial Use License (AMTC)](licenses/AMTC.md)
